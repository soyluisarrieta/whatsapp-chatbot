# WhatsApp ChatBot

üåê English | [**Espa√±ol**](./README-ES.md)

This chatbot, developed in Node.js and using the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library, acts as an intermediary between WhatsApp and your API. It is agnostic to any LLM service. Ideal for custom integrations and automations without usage restrictions.
